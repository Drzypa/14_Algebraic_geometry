This theorem seems to usually be attributed to Malgrange in literature as it appeared in his book\cite{Malgrange}.

\begin{thm}[Malgrange]
Suppose $M \subset {\mathbb{R}}^N$ is a connected smooth ($C^\infty$) submanifold and
$V \subset {\mathbb{R}}^N$ is a real analytic
subvariety of the same dimension as $M$, such that $M \subset V$.  Then $M$ is a real analytic submanifold.
\end{thm}

The condition that $M$ is smooth cannot be relaxed to $C^k$ for $k < \infty$.  For example, note
that in ${\mathbb{R}}^2$, the subvariety $y^3 - x^8 = 0$, which is the graph of the $C^1$ function $y = \lvert x \rvert^{\frac{8}{3}}$, is not a real analytic submanifold.
