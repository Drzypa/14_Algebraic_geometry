The \emph{Segre map} is an embedding $s:\P^n\times\P^m\to\P^{nm+n+m}$ of the product of
two projective spaces into a larger projective space. It is important since it makes the
product of two projective varieties into a projective variety again.
Invariantly, it can described as follows. Let $V,W$ be (finite dimensional) vector spaces; then
\[ \begin{array}{rrclcc}
s: & \P V & \times & \P W & \longrightarrow & \P(V\otimes W) \\
   & [x]  & ,      & [y]  & \longmapsto     & [x\otimes y]
\end{array} \]
In homogeneous coordinates, the pair of points $[x_0:x_1:\cdots:x_n]$, 
$[y_0:y_1:\cdots:y_m]$ maps to 
\[ [x_0y_0:x_1y_0:\cdots:x_ny_0:x_0y_1:x_1y_1:\cdots:x_ny_m]. \]
If we imagine the target space as the projectivized version of the space
of $(n+1)\times (m+1)$ matrices, then the image is exactly the set of matrices
which have rank 1; thus it is the common zero locus of the equations
\[ \left|\begin{array}{cc} a_{ij} & a_{il} \\ a_{kj} & a_{kl} \end{array}\right| 
= a_{ij}a_{kl}-a_{il}a_{kj} = 0 \]
for all $0\le i<k\le n$, $0\le j<l \le m$. Varieties of this form (defined by vanishing
of minors in some space of matrices) are usually called \emph{determinantal varieties}.
