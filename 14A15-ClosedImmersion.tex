\begin{document}
A morphism of schemes $f: (X,\O_X) \lra (Y,\O_Y)$ is a {\em closed immersion} if:
\begin{enumerate}
\item As a map of topological spaces, $f: X \lra Y$ is a homeomorphism from $X$ into a closed subset of $Y$, and
\item the morphism of sheaves $\O_Y \lra \O_X$ associated with $f$ is an \PMlinkname{epimorphism}{AbelianCategory} in the category of sheaves.
\end{enumerate}

This notion is the analog of the notion of \PMlinkname{closed immersion}{Immersion} in the category of differential manifolds.
