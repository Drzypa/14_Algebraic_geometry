\begin{document}
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a sheaf of abelian groups  over a topological space $X$.  Let $\mathcal{G}$ be a sheaf
over $X$, such that for every open set $U \subset X$, $\mathcal{G}(U)$ is a subgroup of
$\mathcal{F}(U)$.  And further let the \PMlinkescapetext{restriction morphisms} on $\mathcal{G}$ be \PMlinkescapetext{induced} by those on $\mathcal{F}$.
Then $\mathcal{G}$ is a \emph{subsheaf} of $\mathcal{F}$.

Suppose a sheaf of abelian groups $\mathcal{F}$ is defined as a disjoint union of stalks $\mathcal{F}_x$ over points $x \in X$, and $\mathcal{F}$ is topologized in the appropriate manner.
In particular, each stalk is an abelian group and the group operations are continuous.
Then a subsheaf $\mathcal{G}$ is an open subset of $\mathcal{F}$ such that $\mathcal{G}_x = 
\mathcal{G} \cap \mathcal{F}_x$ is a subgroup of $\mathcal{F}_x$.

When $\mathcal{G}$ is a subsheaf of $\mathcal{F}$, then 
$\mathcal{F}_x / \mathcal{G}_x$ is an abelian group.  Considering this to be the stalk over $x$
we have a sheaf which is denoted by $\mathcal{F}/\mathcal{G}$, with the topology being the quotient topology.

\begin{example}
Suppose $M$ is a complex manifold.
Let $\mathcal{M}^*$ be the sheaf of germs of meromorphic functions which are not identically zero.  That is, for $z \in M,$ the stalk $\mathcal{M}^*_z$ is the abelian group of germs of meromorphic functions at $z$ with the group operation being multiplication.
Then $\mathcal{O}^*$, the sheaf
of germs of holomorphic functions which are not identically 0 is a subsheaf
of $\mathcal{M}^*$.

The sheaf $\mathcal{M}^* / \mathcal{O}^*$ is then the sheaf of divisors.  If $M$ is of (complex) dimension 1, then
$\mathcal{M}^* / \mathcal{O}^*$ is just the sheaf of functions into the integers with finite support.
