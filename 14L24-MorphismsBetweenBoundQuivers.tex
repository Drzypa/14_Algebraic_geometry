Let $(Q,I)$ and $(Q',I')$ be \PMlinkname{bound quivers}{AdmissibleIdealsBoundQuiverAndItsAlgebra} over the same base field $k$.

\textbf{Definition.} A morphism $F:Q\to Q'$ is said to be \textbf{bounded by $(I,I')$} if \PMlinkname{the induced linear map}{MorphismsOfPathAlgebrasInducedFromMorphismsOfQuivers} $\overline{F}:kQ\to kQ'$ is such that 
$$\overline{F}(I)\subseteq I'.$$
In this case we write
$$F:(Q,I)\to (Q',I')$$
and we say that $F$ is a \textbf{morphism of bound quivers}.

If $F:(Q,I)\to (Q',I')$ is a morphism of bound quivers, then $\overline{F}:kQ\to kQ'$ induces a linear map
$$\overline{\overline{F}}:kQ/I\to kQ'/I'.$$
Furthermore, if $F_0$ is injective, then $\overline{F}$ is a homomorphism of algebras (see \PMlinkname{this entry}{MorphismsOfPathAlgebrasInducedFromMorphismsOfQuivers} for details) and thus $\overline{\overline{F}}$ is a homormorphism of algebras.
