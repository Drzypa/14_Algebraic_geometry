\begin{document}
An algebraic set over an uncountably infinite base field $\mathbb{F}$ (like the real or complex numbers) cannot be countably infinite.

Proof:  Let $S$ be a countably infinite subset of $\mathbb{F}^n$.  By a cardinality argument (see the attachment), there must exist a line such that the projection of this set  to the line is infinite.  Since the projection of an algebraic set to a  linear subspace is an algebraic set, the projection of $S$ to this line would be an algebraic subset of the line.  However, an algebraic subset of a line is the locus of zeros of some polynomial, hence must be finite.  Therefore, $S$ could not be algebraic since that would lead to a contradiction.
