\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a scheme over a field $k$.  Then $X$ is said to be an \emph{abstract variety} over $k$ if it is integral, separated, and of finite type over $k$.  Usually we simply say $X$ is a \emph{variety}.  If $X$ is proper over $k$, it is said to be \emph{complete}.  If the dimension of $X$ is one, then $X$ is said to be a \emph{curve}.
\end{defn}
Some authors also require $k$ to be algebraically closed, and some authors require curves to be nonsingular.  

Calling $X$ a variety would appear to conflict with the preexisting notion of an \PMlinkname{affine}{AffineVariety} or projective variety.  However, it can be shown that if $k$ is algebraically closed, then there is an equivalence of categories between affine abstract varieties over $k$ and affine varieties over $k$, and another between projective abstract varieties over $k$ and projective varieties over $k$. 

This equivalence of categories identifies an abstract variety with the set of its $k$-points; this can be thought of as simply ignoring all the generic points.  In the other direction, it identifies an affine variety with the prime spectrum of its coordinate ring: the variety in $\mathbb{A}^n$ defined by the ideal 
\[
\left<f_1,\ldots,f_m\right>
\]
is identified with
\[
\Spec k[X_1,\ldots,X_n]/\left<f_1,\ldots,f_m\right>.
\]

A projective variety is identified as the gluing together of the affine varieties obtained by taking the complements of hyperplanes.  To see this, suppose we have a projective variety in $\mathbb{P}^n$ given by the homogeneous ideal $\left<f_1,\ldots,f_m\right>$.  If we delete the hyperplane $X_i=0$, then we obtain an affine variety: let $T_j = X_j/X_i$; then the affine variety is the set of common zeros of 
\[
\left<f_1(T_0,\ldots,T_n),\ldots,f_m(T_0,\ldots,T_n)\right>.
\]
In this way, we can get $n+1$ overlapping affine varieties that cover our original projective variety. Using the theory of schemes, we can glue these affine varieties together to get a scheme; the result will be projective. 

For more on this, see Hartshorne's book \emph{Algebraic Geometry}; see the bibliography for algebraic geometry for more resources.
