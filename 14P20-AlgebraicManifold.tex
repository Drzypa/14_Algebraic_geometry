\begin{defn}
Let $k$ be a field and let $M \subset k^n$ be a submanifold.  $M$ is said to
be an \emph{algebraic manifold} (or $k$-algebraic) if there exists an irreducible algebraic
variety $V \subset k^n$ such that $\dim V = \dim M$ and $M \subset V$.  If $k = \mathbb{R}$,
then $M$ is called a \emph{Nash manifold}.
\end{defn}

It can be proved that such a manifold is defined as the zero set of a finite collection of analytic algebraic functions.
