A \emph{group scheme} is a group object in the category of schemes.  Similarly, if $S$ is a scheme, a \emph{group scheme over $S$} is a group object in the category of schemes over $S$.

As usual with schemes, the points of a group scheme are not the whole story.  For example, a group scheme may have only one point over its field of definition and yet not be trivial.  The points of the underlying topological space do not form a group under the obvious choice for a group law. 

We can view a group scheme $G$ as a ``group machine'': given a ring $R$, the set of $R$-points of $G$ forms a group.  If $S$ is a scheme that is not affine, we can nevertheless interpret $G$ as a family of groups fibred over $S$.
