\begin{document}
Let $F \colon \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ be a polynomial map, i.e.,
$$F(x_1,\dots,x_n) = (f_1(x_1,\dots,x_n), \dots,f_n(x_1,\dots,x_n))$$
for certain polynomials $f_i \in \mathbb{C}[X_1,\dots,X_n]$.

If $F$ is invertible, then its Jacobi determinant $\det(\partial f_i/\partial
x_j)$, which is a polynomial over $\mathbb{C}$,
vanishes nowhere and hence must be a non-zero constant.

The \emph{Jacobian conjecture} asserts the converse: every polynomial map
$\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ whose Jacobi determinant is a non-zero constant
is invertible.
