\begin{document}
Conjectures made by Weil on the form of the zeta function of a variety over a finite field.  Specifically he thought it should be rational, it should split into polynomial parts with integral coefficients, with roots of a certain magnitude, and of degree = Betti number.  Further there should be a functional equation.

(Flesh this out ;))
